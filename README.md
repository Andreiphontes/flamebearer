# ðŸ”¥ flamebearer

_A work in progress._

Blazing fast [flame graph](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html) tool for Node and V8,
used to visualize and explore performance profiling results.
Designed to handle profiles of any size while remaining responsive.

## Usage

Use the [online version](https://mapbox.github.io/flamebearer/), or the command line tool:

```bash
# install flamebearer
$ npm install -g flamebearer

# profile your app
$ node --prof app.js

# generate flamegraph.html from a V8 log and open it in the browser
$ node --prof-process --preprocess isolate*.log | flamebearer
```
